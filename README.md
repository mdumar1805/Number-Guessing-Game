# Number-Guessing-Game
Number Guessing Game This is a simple Java console application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts until the correct number is guessed.
